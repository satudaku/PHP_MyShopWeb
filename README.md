## Instruction
Development instruction is based on '**PHP_Developer_Test.pdf**' file. 

## Installation (For windows)
1. Download and install latest XAMPP from [here](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html).
2. Go to htdocs folder under XAMPP root directory (Usually in **C:\xampp\htdocs**, depends on where you installed them).
3. Create a new folder named 'myshopweb' (you can name it something else).
4. Download all PHP_MyShopWeb files and folders (do not change any files' and folders' name or it would not work properly), place it into the new folder you just created.

11. After successfully importing the database, you can type in address bar **localhost/myshopweb/login.php** or if you name the folder differently: **localhost/[new folder name here]/login.php**
